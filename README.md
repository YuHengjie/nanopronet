# NanoProNet

**An “ImageNet” dataset for protein corona research!**

---

NanoProNet is the largest public dataset and foudation model for nanomaterial–protein interaction research.  
It enables both **binary classification** (affinity vs. non-affinity) and **regression prediction** of **relative protein abundance (RPA)**.

---

## 📌 Highlights

- **2.76 million** annotated nanomaterial–protein samples
- Designed for **protein corona** prediction tasks
- Supports:
  - ✅ Affinity / Non-affinity binary classification
  - 📊 Regression of protein abundance within affinity cases
- Structured for machine learning benchmarking

## 🧠 Project Structure

The website consists of four main pages:

- **Home** – Project overview and highlights  
- **Data** – Dataset access and description *(coming soon)*  
- **Model** – Baseline model and usage *(coming soon)*  
- **About** – Background, contributors, and references *(coming soon)*

## 🚀 Get Started

This project includes a static website structure that can be deployed via GitHub Pages.  
The original template was forked and modified from [Hugo Academic CV by HugoBlox](https://github.com/HugoBlox/theme-academic-cv).
